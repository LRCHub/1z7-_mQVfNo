# フランク・シナトラ – My Way

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Some day
when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow
just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Yes you're lovely
with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me
but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word your
tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh
that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Lovely Never ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
<♪>
And that laugh
that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Lovely Never ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Just the way you look tonight
